Paddles is a ping-pong league tracker that allows players to join a league and compare their skill rating (expressed as elo) against other league members. It's mainly comprised of a leaderboard that ranks players according to their rating and a list of recent games. 

# Tech
- jQuery
-  Materialize
-  Node.js
-  ExpressJS
-  Knex.js
-  PostgreSQL

The front-end used the Materialize framework with some extra lifting done with jQuery. The server uses ExpressJS, which talks to the PostgreSQL database with Knex.js.
